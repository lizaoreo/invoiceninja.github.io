When your client purchases this, the Setup charge will only be applied to the first invoice, and then a recurring invoice is generated for any recurring products in the subscription.If you want to allow your clients to move between subscriptions then this is possible by creating a Group and adding each subscription to the group.

The Raiffeisen QR-IID is 30808. If we replace the previous IBAN with this, we get:  CH21 3080 8001 2345 6789 0. This is the QR-IBAN with wrong checksum therefore we have to calculate it. We start with the original checksum (CH21 3080 8001 2345 6789 0). The QR-IBAN should be one for modulo 97. We have to move the first 4 symbols to the end (3080 8001 2345 6789 0 CH21). We replace the checksum 21 with two XX, because we don't know this yet (38080 8001 2345 6789 0 CHXX). After that we replace CH with digits. It is alphabetical and starts with 10. So A=10, B=11 and C=13. Because of that, CH is 1217. This gives us 3080 8001 2345 6789 0 1217XX. We now have to find two numbers that give us the modulo 97 = 1. We start by using 00 for XX. 3080 8001 2345 6789 0 121700 modulo 97 = 32. That is to low. 97-32+1= 66.  3080 8001 2345 6789 0 121766 modulo 97 = 1. Now we got it!

It's usually calculated as a percentage and added to the price of a product or service at the point of sale. Unlike some countries where a value-added tax (VAT) is utilized, in the U.S., there is no national sales tax. Instead, sales tax is levied at the state, county, and sometimes even at the municipal level, making it somewhat complex.This means that the sales tax can vary significantly from one location to another, not just from state to state, but even within a state. For example, in one city, the total sales tax might be 6%, while in another, it might be 9%. Some states, like Oregon and Delaware, don't impose any sales tax at all.Products and services can also be taxed differently. For instance, some states tax groceries, while others don't. Similarly, some states offer tax holidays, specific times during the year when sales tax is not charged on certain items.To accurately calculate sales tax, it's important to know:\nThe precise location of the sale (the \"nexus\").\nThe type of product or service being sold.\nThe current tax rate in that location.\nInvoice Ninja can simplify this process for you by automating the sales tax calculation. It identifies the appropriate tax rate based on the 'ship-to' address on the invoice, and applies it to the taxable items in your invoice. It stays updated with the current tax rates across different locations, ensuring that your invoices are always compliant with the most recent tax laws.\nRemember, managing sales tax correctly is not only good for your business operations, but it's also a legal obligation. Having the ability to automatically calculate sales tax will save you time, reduce errors, and ensure that you're collecting the correct amount of tax on each sale, which is crucial for your business's tax reporting and remittance."},{"id":217,"uri":"\/en\/taxes\/#configure-us-tax-calculations","title":"Taxes","sub_title":"Configure US tax calculations","body":"If you are a hosted Invoice Ninja client with a Pro or Enterprise plan, you can turn on tax calculations with these steps:"},{"id":218,"uri":"\/en\/taxes\/#turn-on-calculate-taxes","title":"Taxes","sub_title":"Turn on Calculate Taxes","body":"Settings > Tax SettingsNavigate to Settings > Tax Settings and turn the Calculate Taxes switch on.

The specifics of what products and services are tax-exempt can vary significantly from one state to another.Common tax-exempt items often include groceries and prescription medicines, as many states aim to reduce the tax burden on essential items. Clothing is another category that is sometimes exempt or taxed at a lower rate, especially in states like Pennsylvania and Minnesota."},{"id":224,"uri":"\/en\/taxes\/#reduced-tax","title":"Taxes","sub_title":"Reduced Tax","body":"In addition to standard and exempt tax rates, many states in the United States also implement reduced tax rates for certain types of goods or services. These reduced rates are generally applied to make essential items more affordable or to stimulate certain sectors of the economy.Reduced tax rates can also apply to certain types of services. For instance, some states might apply a lower tax rate to educational services, medical services, or public transportation."},{"id":225,"uri":"\/en\/taxes\/#override-tax","title":"Taxes","sub_title":"Override Tax","body":"In some circumstances you may wish to override the tax rate on certain products that are outside the typical sales tax scope.

While it might seem similar to tax-exempt items, there is a crucial difference. When an item is zero-rated, it technically remains taxable, but at a rate of 0%. The key advantage here is that while the end consumer doesn't pay any tax on these goods or services, the businesses involved in the supply chain may still reclaim input taxes (if applicable), something that is not allowed for tax-exempt items.However, it's important to note that the concept of zero-rated goods is more commonly associated with countries that use a Value Added Tax (VAT) system, such as those in the European Union or Canada. In these systems, certain essential goods like food or books are often zero-rated to reduce the cost burden on consumers, while still allowing businesses to claim back VAT they've paid on inputs.In the United States, which uses a sales tax system rather than VAT, the concept of zero-rating doesn't apply in the same way. Instead, states usually categorize goods and services as either taxable, exempt, or taxable at a reduced rate."},{"id":227,"uri":"\/en\/taxes\/#reverse-tax-(use-tax)","title":"Taxes","sub_title":"Reverse Tax (Use Tax)","body":"The concept of \"reverse tax\" is often used in the context of \"use tax\". In the United States, a use tax is typically a type of tax charged to consumers who purchase goods or services from outside their home state for use in their home state, and where no sales tax has been charged.Essentially, use tax is the counterpart to sales tax and is designed to discourage consumers from buying out-of-state in order to avoid sales tax. It also helps to level the playing field between in-state retailers (who have to charge sales tax) and out-of-state retailers (who often don't).The rate of use tax is generally the same as the sales tax that would have been charged if the purchase had been made in-state. Therefore, if you buy an item tax-free from an online retailer located in another state, but you use the item in your home state, you're usually responsible for paying use tax to your state.Keep in mind, it's typically the buyer's responsibility to calculate, report, and remit use tax to the appropriate tax authority. This can get complicated for businesses making numerous out-of-state purchases. However, some states require larger businesses or those with a significant presence (nexus) in the state to charge use tax at the point of sale, effectively reversing the normal taxation process, hence the term \"reverse tax\"."},{"id":228,"uri":"\/en\/taxes\/#tax-exemptions","title":"Taxes","sub_title":"Tax Exemptions","body":"In the realm of sales tax, tax exemptions are specific scenarios where sales tax does not have to be paid on certain goods, services, or transactions. These exemptions are set by the tax authority, often at the state level in the United States, and can vary greatly from one state to another.Product-based Exemptions: Certain types of goods may be exempt from sales tax. For example, necessities like groceries and prescription medications are often tax-exempt. Clothing is also exempt in some states, and many states offer temporary exemptions for back-to-school supplies during certain periods of the year.Use-based Exemptions: This refers to situations where an item is used in a way that qualifies it to be tax-exempt. For instance, goods that are purchased for resale are often exempt from sales tax, as the tax will ultimately be paid by the end consumer. Similarly, items used in manufacturing or items purchased by non-profit organizations are often tax-exempt.Buyer-based Exemptions: In some cases, the buyer's status can lead to a tax exemption. For instance, government agencies, non-profit organizations, and certain other groups may not have to pay sales tax on their purchases.Transaction-based Exemptions: Certain types of sales transactions may be exempt from sales tax. For example, sales involving interstate commerce may be exempt in some cases.If you sell goods and services to a client who is tax exempt, you can mark them as tax exempt by editing their client record and setting the tax exempt switch on."},{"id":229,"uri":"\/en\/taxes\/#configure-eu-tax-calculations","title":"Taxes","sub_title":"Configure EU tax calculations","body":"Currently we only support tax calculations for German based users.

One of the values that can be set in this file is \"APP_DEBUG\". This value controls whether or not detailed error messages are displayed when an error occurs in the application.When \"APP_DEBUG\" is set to \"true\", Laravel will display detailed error messages that can include sensitive information such as the file path, database credentials, and other configuration details. This information can be used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the application and its underlying infrastructure.Leaving \"APP_DEBUG\" set to \"true\" in a production environment is a security concern because it can allow attackers to gain valuable information about the application and its environment. Attackers can use this information to craft targeted attacks against the application or its users, and can also use it to gain unauthorized access to the underlying infrastructure.To mitigate this security concern, it is recommended to set \"APP_DEBUG\" to \"false\" in the \".env\" file of a production environment. This will prevent detailed error messages from being displayed and help to protect the application and its users from potential attacks. Additionally, it is important to ensure that all sensitive information is properly secured and not exposed in error messages or other application outputs.The following CVEs have been reported exploiting this:\nCVE-2020-15168: Laravel 7.x before 7.27.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code because of an \"Unrestricted File Upload\" vulnerability via a request to \"\/debugbar\/file\".\nCVE-2019-16785: Laravel Framework through 5.8.35 allows unauthorized remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via a crafted web site that is mishandled by the \"artisan serve\" command.\nCVE-2018-15133: In Laravel Framework through 5.5.40 and 5.6.x through 5.6.29, remote code execution might occur as a result of an unserialize call on a potentially untrusted X-XSRF-TOKEN value, because of the fallback mechanism for CSRF tokens.\nThese vulnerabilities demonstrate the potential for serious security issues when APP_DEBUG=true is left enabled in a production environment.
